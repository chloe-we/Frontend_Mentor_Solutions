## My process

- I decided to contain the main content of the page in an `<article>` element instead of a `<div>` element. I believe this is the better alternative for semantic HTML. I wasn't sure if it should be an `<article>` element or a `<section>` element. If anyone has a better solution please let me know.
- I stored all the provided styles in CSS variables for easier usage and changes.
- I started by getting all the content contained in the HTML done. Then I tried to work from the top to bottom while styling. I did jump around a little bit, and I went back to adjust the html a few times to improve the semantics.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS variables
- Mobile-first design

### What I Learned

The biggest thing was how to pull information from a Figma design file to write my code. I learned how to find simple things like padding and corner radius. I also learned the more tricky things, like how to get the box shadow information.

### Continued Development

In the future I'm hoping to practice more advanced CSS, learn JS, and start integrating new tools.
